## Solutions Included

### Task 1: Gate Tomography
The U3 gate parameters were calculated to make a set of universal gates equivalent to a Toffoli gate.

### Task 2: Complex Amplitudes
A routine was implemented to prepare a two-qubit quantum state from a set of complex amplitudes.  
- Normalization was enforced and the state vector was constructed manually.  
- Unit tests were included to validate the solution.  
- The solution was generalized to prepare three-qubit states as a stretch goal.

### Task 3: Error Correction
A noise model with random Pauli X/Z errors was built.  
- The Quantum Repetition Code, Shor Code, and Hamming Code were implemented and tested.  
- Differences and challenges of each error correction code were analyzed.

### Task 4: Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)
Two circuit-based models were developed for binary classification using the Iris dataset.  
- Different circuit architectures were designed, preprocessing was applied, and expressibility was evaluated.  
- Performance, circuit depth, and scalability were compared between models.
